############## RB 109 test prep ##########

=begin

Test checklist:
local variable scope, especially how local variables interact with method invocations with blocks and method definitions
mutating vs non-mutating methods, pass-by-reference vs pass-by-value
working with collections (Array, Hash, String), and popular collection methods (each, map, select, etc). Review the two lessons on these topics thoroughly.
variables as pointers
puts vs return
false vs nil and the idea of truthiness (truthy and falsy values)
method definition and method invocation
implicit return value of method invocations and blocks
how the Array#sort method works

### Ruby's syntactical sugar and Where does the code come from?

puts "hello" #same as puts("hello")

string = 'a string'

def string
  'a method'
end

p string
p string()

# 1) "puts" method invocation. Parentheses are optional.
# 2) In order to invoke a method instead of local variable use method() (include optional parenthases)
# 3) In order to invoke method not from the core library, you must "require" the method first.

###Local Variable scope

Variable intiialization variable re-assignment visually look the same.

Local variables initialized in the local scope are accessible inside blocks.
Variables initialized inside a block is not accessible outside the block.

### Pass by reference vs pass by value

def amethod(param)
  param += " world" # Re-assignemnet, returns a new string object.
  # or param + " world" # Concatenation, returns a new string object and makes no change to param.
  # or param << " world" # Mutates the str object.
end

str = 'hello'
amethod(str)

p str

# Variables as pointers:

a = 'hello'
b = a

b << ' world'

#----- 2 variables; 1 object

p a
p b

a += b # re-assignment of variable a to a new object. 

#----- 2 variables; 2 objects

b << ' universe'

p a #=> "Hello worldhello world"
p b #=> "Hello world universe"

arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

idx = 0

# loop do
#   puts arr[idx]
#   idx += 1
#   break if idx == arr.size
# end # Returns nil.

# arr.each do |x|
#   puts x if x > 5
# end # Returns original array.

# Append 12 to the end of array.
arr << 12

# Prepend 0 to beginnning of array

arr.unshift(0)

# Remove the 12 and add a 3

arr.pop
arr << 3

# Remove duplicates using 1 method.

arr.uniq!

# Extract all odd numbers into new array.

odds = arr.select { |x| x.odd?}

# Increment all numbers by 1

incremented = arr.map {|x| x+=1}

p odds
p arr
p incremented

Hash

hsh = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}

# Get the value of "b"
# Can't get the value of "b", only :b

p hsh[:b]

# Add this key/value pair to the hash: {e:5}

hsh[:e] = 5
p hsh

# Iterate over the has and print out the keys and values

hsh.each do |k,v|
  puts "Key is #{k}, value is #{v}"
end

# Print out the key value pairs where the value is less than 3.5

hsh.each do |k,v|
  puts "Key is #{k}, value is #{v}" if v < 3.5
end

# return a new hash where value is less than 3.5

new_hsh = hsh.select do |k,v|
  v < 3.5
end

p new_hsh

# Delete all key/value pairs where value is less than 3.5

hsh.delete_if do |k,v|
  v < 3.5
end

p hsh
